In order to run/compile the code, please either:
	-Open the entire Project2 folder as a project in IntelliJ, then run the program as the Main method. 
	-Compile and Run the BattleBoatsBoard class inside of the src folder, from the command line.
----------------------------------------
Bugs/Defects:
	-I would not consider this a bug considering it was not clearly defined as what to do in this scenario,
	 but, my code utilizes the fire method when using the missile method and thus updates the shots fired
	 for each of the 9 strikes of the missile.

Enjoy!
