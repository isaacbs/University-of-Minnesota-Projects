Compile and run the HashTable.java file from the command line or open the folder as a project in IntelliJ and run the main method in it.
Make sure that the 'gettysburg.txt' and 'keywords.txt' files are within the same directory as the java class.
Project only features one hash function because it was effective enough to run on both the general and specific cases more efficiently than was required for this project.
No known bugs.
