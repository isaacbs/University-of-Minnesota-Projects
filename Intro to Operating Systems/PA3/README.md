# Project #3 â€“ Multithreading
* Group Number 55
* test machine: csel-kh1250-03.cselabs.umn.edu
* Isaac Blaine-Sauer -- BLAIN075
* Peter Ortiz -- ORTIZ363
* We did complete the extra credit
* We both feel as though we contributed equally
* Isaac completed the locks, log file, and extra credit.
* Peter completed the parse function and contributed to the locks as well, and the result file.
* Our program runs even better than the test files if you consider a higher accuracy to mean better results. 
* Please Consider this when looking at test results.
# Running Instructions
* * Run make clean; make
* * Use make run# (where # is a number between 1 and 5) to run each of the scenarios
* * Use make t# (where # is a number between 1 and 5) to run each of the tests
# Flags:
* Use flags to either generate a log file (found in output) or to set a specific buffer size:
* "-b" for buffer followed by an integer
* "-p" to produce a log
* "-bp" to set a buffer size and generate a log file, followed by an integer

* Thank you!
